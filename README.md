# Happy_Sad_Image_Classification
----
This is a machine learning project that classifies images into two categories: Happy and Sad. The model is trained using a dataset of images that depict facial expressions and is capable of recognizing whether a person in an image is showing a happy or sad expression.

*Project Overview*
This project uses deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify images based on facial expressions. The goal is to create an application that can identify whether a person in an image is smiling or showing a sad expression.

*Technologies Used*
  -Python
  -TensorFlow / Keras
  -OpenCV (for image processing)
  -NumPy
  -Matplotlib (for visualization)
  -Scikit-learn (for model evaluation)
  -Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)

The model architecture is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are ideal for image classification tasks. The key layers include:

  -Convolutional layers for feature extraction
  -Max-pooling layers for down-sampling
  -Fully connected layers for final classification
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial expressions to distinguish between "Happy" and "Sad" faces.
